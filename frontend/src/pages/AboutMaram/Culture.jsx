      <h1 className="culture-title">Maram Culture</h1>
      <p className="culture-description">
        The Maram people are known for their rich and vibrant cultural heritage. Their society is deeply rooted in 
        traditions that revolve around agriculture, religious practices, and their unique social structure. The Marams 
        are also known for their distinctive customs, festivals, clothing, and festivals like Punghi and Kanghi, which 
        celebrate the changing seasons and important milestones in their community life. Despite the introduction of 
        Christianity, the Marams still maintain their ancestral traditions.
      </p>
      <h2 className="culture-subtitle">Festivals and Rituals</h2>
      <p className="culture-text">
        The Marams celebrate several festivals, among which Punghi (celebrated in July) and Kanghi (celebrated in 
        December) are the most prominent. These festivals are marked by traditional dances, songs, and communal feasts. 
        The Mangkang festival, dedicated to women, is another unique celebration that occurs in April each year.
      </p>
      <h2 className="culture-subtitle">Social Structure</h2>
      <p className="culture-text">
        The Maram society is traditionally divided into clans based on kinship ties. They follow a patriarchal lineage system 
        and have a hierarchical social structure, with each village having a chief or head (Sagong). The Marams maintain 
        an age-old tradition of monarchy, with a king or queen playing a central role in preserving the culture and customs.
      </p>
      <h2 className="culture-subtitle">Clothing and Daily Life</h2>
      <p className="culture-text">
        The Maram people wear traditional garments made from cotton, with men wearing black cotton kilts embellished with 
        cowrie shells or buttons, while women wear similar loincloths and shawls. Their daily life is largely centered around 
        agriculture, with both men and women working together in rice cultivation. Women handle most of the domestic chores 
        such as fetching water, cooking, and caring for children, while men are primarily responsible for ploughing and 
        felling trees.
